# MBT Bundle [![Build Status][actions_badge]][actions_link] [![Coverage Status][coveralls_badge]][coveralls_link]

This Bundle provides ability to test your application using Model Based Testing
techique.

The major features are:
1. Allow to test your application even though the application is not implemented yet.
2. Automatically generate test cases when a task is created.
3. Automatically execute those test cases to test your application.
4. Automatically reduce reproduce path when a bug is found.
5. Automatically report the bug when the reproduce path is reduced.

All you have to do:
1. Define models to describe your application.
2. Define subjects to interact with your application.
3. Create tasks based on your need. e.g.:
    1. Test the whole application to make sure there are no bugs in the application.
    2. Test only models that have a tag to make sure the part of your application is still working while developing a feature.
    3. Test a model to make sure a bug that has been fixed is not regressed.
4. Manage bugs that has been found. e.g. mark a bug has been fixed.
5. You don't have to maintains test cases that has been generated automatically, instead, you may need
   to maintains models and subjects.

## Requirements

* PHP 7.2 / 7.3 / 7.4
* Symfony 4.4 / 5.0 / 5.1
* See also the `require` section of [composer.json](composer.json)

## Installation

### Step 1: Create symfony project

Before testing your application, you need to create new **symfony project**
to use this bundle:

```console
$ composer create-project symfony/skeleton my-project
```

### Step 2: Download the Bundle

Install lastest version of this bundle:

```console
$ composer require tienvx/mbt-bundle "^1.17"
```

### Step 3: Config file storage

In order to save screenshots of bug report, we need to install flysystem bundle:

```console
$ composer require league/flysystem-bundle
```

Then configure file system:
```yaml
flysystem:
    storages:
        # Name of the storage is matter
        mbt.storage:
            adapter: 'local'
            options:
                directory: '%kernel.project_dir%/var/storage/screenshots'
```

### Step 4: Create models and subjects

Model is the way to describe part your application. Subject is
the way to tell this bundle to interact with your application.

## Testing

You can run the tests with:
```console
$ php tests/app/bin/console cache:clear # Only if you added new code
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Validate code with coding standards

```console
$ php-cs-fixer fix --diff --dry-run
```
